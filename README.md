## Objective

This is a coding exercise which will allow you to demonstrate how you code and your approach to a given problem.

You will be assessed on:
 - Your ability to write clean, well-tested and reusable code. 
 - How you have understood, interpreted the business rules and ensured they are correctly met. 
 - Identifying the ambiguity within the business rules and handle accordingly.

### Business Rules

 - There are 3 types of tickets i.e. INFANT, CHILD, and ADULT. 
 - The ticket prices are based on the type of ticket (see table below). 
 - The ticket purchaser declares how many and what type of tickets they want to buy. 
 - Multiple tickets can be purchased at any given time. 
 - Only a maximum of 25 tickets that can be purchased at a time. 
 - An INFANT does not pay for a ticket and are not allocated a seat. They will be sitting on an ADULT lap. 
 - CHILD and INFANT tickets cannot be purchased without purchasing an ADULT ticket.

| Ticket Type | Price|
|-------------|------|
|INFANT|£0|
|CHILD|£17.50|
|ADULT|£25.99|
 - There is an existing `PaymentService` responsible for taking payments. 
 - There is an existing `SeatReservationService` responsible for reserving seats.

### Constraints

 - The `CinemaTicketsService` interface MUST not be modified.
 - The code in `uk.gov.dwp.engineering.recruitment.domain` package MUST not be modified with the exception of BookingConfirmation, which may be extended in a non-breaking manner if you choose to do so.

### Assumptions

You can assume:
 - All accounts with an id greater than zero are valid. They also have sufficient funds to pay for any number of tickets. 
 - The `PaymentService` implementation is an external provider with no defects. 
 - You do not need to worry about how the actual payment happens or integrating that service. 
 - The payment will always go through once a payment request has been made to the `PaymentService`. 
 - The `SeatReservationService` implementation is an external provider with no defects. 
 - You do not need to worry about how the seat reservation algorithm works or integrating that service. 
 - The seats will always be reserved once a reservation request has been made to the `SeatReservationService`.

Any assumptions outside of the list above should be correctly and thoroughly documented.

### Your Task

Provide a working implementation of ‘CinemaTicketsServiceImpl` that:
 - Considers the above objective, business rules, constraints & assumptions. 
 - Calculates the correct amount for the requested tickets and makes a payment request to the `PaymentService`. 
 - Calculates the correct number of seats to reserve and makes a seat reservation request to the `SeatReservationService`. 
 - Rejects any invalid ticket purchase requests. 
 - It is up to you to identify what should be deemed as an invalid purchase request. 
 - Please ensure you record your approach and any assumptions you make in the `README.md` of your final solution and within your submitted repository. 
 - Ensure appropriate error handling and testing is implemented for the ‘CinemaTicketsController’ referring to all business rules and rejected ticket requests.
